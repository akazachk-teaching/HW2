    "The idea behind our mechanism was to include preferred meeting times in the optimization model from the lecture. \n",
    "We divided the day into two groups: day (1) and evening (2). For the evening not to have a higher weight than the morning (the data is categorical nominal data), we chose to minimize the maximum difference in preferred meeting times between two team members in each team. The day can be devided into more groups, but the problem very quickly becomes very difficult to solve when there is a lot of students and a lot of possible meeting times.\n",
    "To still make sure the groups are even, constraints about the theory score and coding score are added to the model.\n",
    " \n",
    "An excel file as a csv file from each student should be saved in a folder. Each excel file should have one row and three columns, where the student's coding score, theory score and preferred meeting time is specified.\n",
    "For the purpose of testing the model randomized data is used. "
